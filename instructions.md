Ticket 1

- First thing we make sure we're using the "GET" method to call the data.

- passed in a callback async function with 2 params, the request and the response

- I used a try/catch block to make sure errors are caught to be checked

- I store the astronaught data within a variable so I can access it.

- if successful return status 200 and the fuccess - true and then followed by all the data

- if error is caught return error 500 and the success - failed and a failed message
